The project compares different common zero-dimensional models (limited mechanisms) for solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth in lithium-ion batteries, focusing on the formation cycle and early cycles, using PyBaMM. It accompanies the article
> K. Manmi, M. Tuchel, E. Kendrick, F. Brosa Planella, [A Comparison of Standard SEI Growth Models in the Context of Battery Formation](https://doi.org/10.1149/1945-7111/ad8548), J. Electrochem. Soc., 171 (2024) 100530.

This work is supported by [The Faraday Institution](https://www.faraday.ac.uk) "Multi-Scale Modelling" project [EP/S003053/1 grant number FIRG059].

## 🚀 Installing the package
The package is not yet available on PyPI so it needs to be installed from the source code. These instructions assume that you have a compatible Python version installed (between 3.9 and 3.12).

### Linux and macOS
First clone the repository, either from the command line or using a Git client:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mmsg-warwick/zero-dimension-comparison-SEI.git
```

If you do not have nox installed, install it with

```bash
python3 -m pip install nox
```

Then, navigate to the repository you just cloned and run

```bash
nox -s dev
```

This will create a virtual environment called `venv` in your current directory and install the package in editable mode with all the development dependencies. To activate the virtual environment, run

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

You can now run the examples in the `examples` directory.

If needed, you can deactivate your virtual environment with

```bash
deactivate
```

### Windows
First clone the repository, either from the command line or using a Git client:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mmsg-warwick/zero-dimension-comparison-SEI.git
```

If you do not have nox installed, install it with

```bash
python3 -m pip install nox
```

Then, navigate to the repository you just cloned and run

```bash
nox -s dev
```

This will create a virtual environment called `venv` in your current directory and install the package in editable mode with all the development dependencies. To activate the virtual environment, run

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
if you are using Command Prompt, or
```bash
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
if you are using PowerShell.


You can now run the examples in the `examples` directory.

If needed, you can deactivate your virtual environment with

```bash
deactivate
```
